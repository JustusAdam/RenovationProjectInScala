Renovation Project
=====

This will be the solution to a university training exercise originally designed to be implemented in Java, however I liked the 
idea of attempting an implementation in Scala. 

The assignment originally includes jUnit tests which the implementation has
to pass. Since I am not entirely sure I'd be allowed to upload those tests I'll eventually write a few tests of my own.

Description

soon

Status

- It compiles!
- The majority of tests pass, but some don't and the reason does not appear to be all that obvious, so I suspect a 
major bug in my implementation.
